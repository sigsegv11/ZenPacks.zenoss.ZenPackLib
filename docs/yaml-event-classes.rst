Event Classes
#############

.. note::

     When you define an event class and/or mapping which already exists, any settings defined in your ZenPack 
     will overwrite existing settings.

Event Classes are used to group together specific types of events.  This can be useful for situations where an event should be dropped or text should be altered to be more human readable.  This is typically done through a python transform.

To define a class, supply the path to the class or classes.  Then, for each event class, supply the appropriate properties for the class.  These include the option to remove the event class during ZenPack installation/uninstallation, description, and a transform.  You can also define mappings to apply to events based on a key and supply an explanation and/or resolution to an issue.

The following example shows an example of a `zenpack.yaml` file with an example of a definition of an event class.

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: ZenPacks.acme.Events

    event_classes:
      /Status/Acme:
        remove: false
        description: Acme event class
        mappings:
          Widget:
            eventClassKey: WidgetEvent
            sequence:  10
            remove: true
            transform: |-
              if evt.message.find('Error reading value for') >= 0:
                  evt._action = 'drop'

.. note::

     When assigning values to multi-line fields such as **transform** or **example**, the best way to preserve whitespace 
     and readability is to use the 
     
     **transform: \|-**
       **if evt.message.find('Error reading value for') >= 0:**
           **evt._action = 'drop'**
     
     style convention demonstrated.  As this example demonstrates, the indented line following
     the **"\|-"** style character becomes the first line of the transform, with subsequent whitespace preserved.

  :Required: No
  :Type: map<name, :ref:`Event Class Mapping <event-class-mapping-fields>`>
  :Default Value: None

.. _event-class-mapping-fields:
