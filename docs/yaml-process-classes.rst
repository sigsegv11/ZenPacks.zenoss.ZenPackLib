Process Classes
###############

.. note::

   When you define a process class organizer and/or class which already exists, any settings defined in your ZenPack 
   will overwrite existing settings.

Process Classes are used to define sets of similar running processes using a regular
expression.  You can then monitor various aspects of the running processes, such as
cpu and memory usage, with a datasource.

To define a class, supply the Process Class Organizer under which the Process Class
will reside.  Optionally add a description of the organizer.  Then, for each Process
Class, supply the processes to include/exclude, description, and replacement text.
You can also optionally override specific zProperties of a process class, such as
zMonitor or zFailSeverity.  See the :ref:`Process Class Fields <process-class-fields>` section below.

The following example shows an example of a `zenpack.yaml` file with an example
of a definition of a process class.
